# Immigration-Management-CRUD-System

This is an airport immigration management system built as a part of the DBMS course.
It allows for CRUD functionality along with the implementation of all the mandatory requirements.
The back-end is done using mysql cursors in Python. The front-end is using Streamlit library in Python.

In order to run the project, first the tableCreation.sql file in the Tables Creation folder has to be run.
Then the app.py file has to be run as:
"streamlit run app.py"
